Project Description:
Build a full-stack food ordering application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application should allow users to browse the menu, add items to the cart, place orders, track order status, and make secure payments using Stripe. An admin panel is required for managing menu items, viewing orders, and updating order statuses.

Functional Requirements:

Authentication:

User registration and login (via JWT tokens).

Password hashing using bcrypt.

Support for logout functionality.

Menu Management:

Fetch the menu from MongoDB and display it in a React frontend.

Admins can add, update, or delete menu items.

Cart Management:

Allow users to add and remove items from the cart.

Display the cart contents with a dynamic total cost.

Order Management:

Enable users to place orders and save order details in MongoDB.

Implement order status tracking (e.g., "Pending," "Processing," "Delivered").

Payment Integration:

Use Stripe for handling payments securely.

Save payment transaction details in the database.

Admin Panel:

Separate route for admins with authentication.

View all orders and their statuses.

Update order statuses dynamically.

UI/UX:

Responsive design using CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap.

Ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

Tech Stack and Tools:

Frontend: React.js (with React Router and Axios for API requests).

Backend: Node.js with Express.js.

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema management).

Payment Gateway: Stripe API.

Authentication: JWT for token-based authentication.

Deployment: Use Vercel for frontend and Render/Heroku for backend.
